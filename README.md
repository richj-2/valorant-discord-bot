# valorant-discord-bot
### A discord bot that allows you to see the valorant immortal leaderboards.
### Depends: discord, requests, bs4, selenium, html5lib
### Recent Firefox release must be installed

### Rename variables.py.dummy to variables.py and insert your bot token there
### Run via bot.py

#### THIS IS MY FIRST PROGRAM, feel free to give me feedback
##### I accidently kept in my bot's token. but discord automatically changed it so...
###### I also left my commented out code that doesn't work so just ignore that....

#### If you want to use this bot just copy the code and add the token at the bottom where it has my token
